Program 1:
Aim: To Implement the FIND-S Algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on given training data which is in the form of CSV file.
Description:
The find-S algorithm is a basic concept learning algorithm in machine learning. The find-S algorithm finds the most specific hypothesis that fits all the positive examples. We have to note here that the algorithm considers only those positive training example. The find-S algorithm starts with the most specific hypothesis and generalizes this hypothesis each time it fails to classify an observed positive training data. Hence, the Find-S algorithm moves from the most specific hypothesis to the most general hypothesis. 
Algorithm:
1.	Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H 
 
2.	For each positive training instance x For each attribute constraint ai in h 
If the constraint ai is satisfied by x Then do nothing 
Else replace ai in h by the next more general constraint that is satisfied by x 
3.	Output hypothesis h 
Program:

import numpy as np
#to read the data in the csv file
data = pd.read_csv("/content/data1.csv")
print(data,"n")
#making an array of all the attributes
d = np.array(data)[:,:-1]
print("n The attributes are: ",d)
#segragating the target that has positive and negative examples
target = np.array(data)[:,-1]
print("n The target is: ",target)
#training function to implement find-s algorithm
